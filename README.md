#do-to-do The Python code snippet is a concise to-do list program. It uses a list named tasks to store tasks, and three functions (add_task, remove_task, and list_tasks) to manipulate the task list. The main program loop repeatedly presents options to the user, allowing them to add tasks, remove tasks, list all tasks, or quit the program. Input validation is included to handle invalid choices. This code provides a minimal yet functional implementation for managing a to-do list in a terminal or console environment.
